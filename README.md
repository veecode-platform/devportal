# [Backstage](https://backstage.io)

This is your newly scaffolded Backstage App, Good Luck!

To start the app, run:

```sh
# To load the scripts and start the distribution process of dynamic plugins
# Note: This command runs `yarn install` at the root, then performs all the dynamic plugins processes, and finally checks if there are updates in `dynamic-plugins-root` to expose the plugins to the application.
yarn init-local

# How to Start Locally
yarn dev
#or
yarn dev-local # To force the use of app-config.local.yaml
```
